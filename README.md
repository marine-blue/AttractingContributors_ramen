# Attracting Contributors
As part of the Software Engineering Class, we would like to simulate how Open Source Projects start and try to attract potential contributions.

# Rules

1. Please choose a hobby or some interest that you want to build your repository
2. Make a README to announce this theme (i.e., my favourite video games or anime)
3. Attract - Go to https://github.com/NAIST-SE/AttractingContributors/discussions, post an interesting message to ask other members to add a list. See example below.
